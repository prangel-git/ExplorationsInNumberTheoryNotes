# Group

A group $(G, \cdot, e)$ is an algebraic structure where $G$ is a nonempty set,  $\cdot:G \times G \to G$ is a binary operation, and $e \in G$ is a so called identity element. A group must satisfy the following axioms:

- [Associativity] The operation $\cdot$ is associative, namely $a \cdot (b \cdot c) = (a \cdot b) \cdot c$.
- [Identity] $e \in G$ is an identity for the operation $\cdot$. Namely, $a \cdot e = e \cdot a$, for every $a \in G$.
- [Inverses] For every $a \in G$, there is a $b \in G$ such that $a \cdot b = b \cdot a = e$

Often, instead of writing the whole triple $(G, \cdot, e)$, we simply say that the set $G$ is a group (It probably would be better to say that $G$ has a group structure. Or probably even better to say that the operation $\cdot$ makes $G$ a group).

A group is called **abelian** if its operation is commutative. That is $a \cdot b = b \cdot a$.

The number of elements of a group $|G|$ is called the **order** of $G$.

## Theorem 

The set of units of a ring $R$ with unity forms a group called **the group of units** of $R$, and denoted by $R^\times$

## Lemma
Let $G$ be a group and $g \in G$ be an element such that $g^b=1$ for some positive integer $b$. Then for any integer $k$, $g^k=g^{k \mod b}$.

## Definition 
The order of an element $g \in G$ is the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $g^k=1$. We denote the order by $|g|$, and if no positive integer exists, we write $|g| = \infty$.

## Lemma
If $g^b=1$ then $|g|$ divides $b$.

## Lemma
In a finite group, every element has finite order.

# Euler totient function

**The euler totient function** is defined for every positive integer $n$ by $\phi(n):= \left| \mathbb{Z}/(n)^\times \right|$

## Lemma
For $p$ and $q$ prime numbers

- $\phi(p^k) = p^k-p^{k-1}$
- $\phi(pq) = (p-1)(q-1)$

## Theorem
let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $\gcd(n, 10) = 1$. Then, the period of the decimal expansion of $1/n$ is the order of $10 \in \mathbb{Z}/(n)^\times$.
