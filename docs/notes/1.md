# Human conception of number

- Lebombo bone: 55 tally marks into a wolf bone from 37,000 years ago.
- Tallying marks are inneficient for large quantities. This leads to cypherization
- Do numbers predate written language?
- Egyptians: Different symbols for different values
- Hindu Arabic system uses different positions to represent different numbers.
- Cuneiform (Ancient mesopotamia) is a positional number system. The lack of zero presents difficulties. 
- Discovery of irrational numbers often attributad to Hippasus of Metapontum (Fifth century BCE)
- Negative numbers were not immediately accepted in europe. Similarly to imaginary numbers.

# Algebraic number systems

- Group numbers by their features.

## Common number systems

- $\mathbb{N}$ Natural numbers (starting at 1)
- $\mathbb{Z}$ Integers
- $\mathbb{Q}$ Rationals
- $\mathbb{R}$ Reals
- $\mathbb{C}$ Complex

# Candidates to new number systems

- Imaginary number $i$ leading to Gaussian integers $\mathbb{Z}[i]$, Gaussian rationals $\mathbb{Q}[i]$, and complex numbers $\mathbb{R}[i]=\mathbb{C}$
- An indeterminate number $x$, leading to polynomials with different types of coefficients.
