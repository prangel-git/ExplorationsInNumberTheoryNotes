# Congruency

We denote the resudue of dividing $a \in \mathbb{Z}$ by $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ as $a \mod n$. 

Two integers $a$ and $b$ are **congruent modulo** $n$, denoted by $a \equiv b \pmod{n}$ means that $a \mod n = b \mod n$. Congruency turns out to be an equivalence relationship. The equivalence classes with respect to this relationship are called **congruence classes**, and denoted by $[a]_n$ (we may drop the subscript $n$ when it is clear from the context).

# Ring of integers modulo $n$

The **ring of integers modulo** $n$ is the set 

$$
\mathbb{Z}/(n):= \{[0]_n, \dots, [n-1]_n \}
$$

together with addition defined as:

$$
[a]+[b] = [a+b]
$$

and multiplication defined as:

$$
[a] \cdot [b] = [a \cdot b]
$$

#### Note that we need to check that the operations are well defined, and that the structure actually forms a ring.

## Lemma 

The operations of addition and multiplication are well defined.

## Lemma

The structure $(\mathbb{Z}/(n), +, \cdot, 0, 1) forms a ring
