# Problem
Given $a,b,c \in \mathbb{Z}$, find $x, y \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that

$$
ax+by=c
$$

**The solution of this problem relies on the multiplicative structure of $\mathbb{Z}$**


Note that **"divides"** is a partial order over a commutative ring, meaning that "divides" satisfies the following properties:

1. [Reflexivity] For every $a$, $a \mid a$
2. [Antisymmetric] If $a \mid b$ and $b \mid a$ then $a=b$
3. [Transitive] If $a \mid b$ and $b \mid c$ then $a \mid c$


A **common divisor** of $a$ and $b$ is an integer $d$ such that $d \mid a$ and $d \mid b$. 

A **greatest common divisor** of $a$ and $b$ is a common divisor of $a$ and $b$ which is largest in the order given by $\mid$. One can prove that greatest common divisors are unique up to multiplication by invertible elements. The greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ will be denoted by $\gcd(a, b)$. 


### Lemma 

Suppose that $d$ is a common divisor of $a$ and $b$. Then $d$ divides $a x + b y$

#### Corollary

If $d$ divides any two of $a$, $b$, and $a+b$, it divides the third.

#### Corollary

$\gcd(a,b) = \gcd(b,a) = \gcd(a, b-a)$


## Theorem

Given integers $a$ and $b$ with $b>0$, there exists unique integers $q$ and $r$ such that $a=bq+r$ with $0 \geq r < b$.

We define $a \text{ mod } b := r$.

### Lemma

$\gcd(a,b)=gcd(b, a\text{ mod }b)$

## Theorem

For natural numbers $a$ and $b$, let $r_{-1}=a$, $r_0=b$, and for $i \geq 0$ define $r_{i+1}= r_{i-1} \text{ mod } r_i$. Then there exists an $n$ such that $r_n=0$, and $r_{n-1}=\gcd(a,b)$.

#### Corollary

For every $k>0$, $\gcd(ka, kb)= k \gcd(a,b)$

#### Corollary

if $g = \gcd(a, b) \neq 0$ then $a/g$ and $b/g$ are relatively prime integers.

## Theorem [Bezout's identity]

For every $a$ and $b$ natural numebers, there exist $x$ and $y$ integers such that 

$$
\gcd(a,b) = ax+by
$$

## Theorem

For $a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z}$ the equation $ax + by = c$ has an integer solution if and only if $\gcd(a,b) \mid c$.


### Lemma [Euclid's lemma]
If $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime and $a \mid bc$ then $a \mid c$


## Theorem

Let $x_0$, $y_0$ be a solution to $ax+by=c$, then any other solution is parametrized as:

$$
x=x_0-t \left(\frac{b}{\gcd(a,b)} \right) \qquad
y=y_0-t \left(\frac{a}{\gcd(a,b)} \right)
$$

## Theorem [Bezout's identity restated]

The smallest positive linear combination of $a$ and $b$ equals the largest integer dividing both $a$ and $b$.
