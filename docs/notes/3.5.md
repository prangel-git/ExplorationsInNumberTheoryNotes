### Lemma

Every composite $n \in \mathbb{N}$ has a prime divisor $p$ with $p \leq \sqrt{n}$ 

# Erastosthenes Sieve

- Start with a list from 2 to $k$
- Circle the smalles number not circled and not crossed from the list.
- Cross all the multiples of the last number you circled.
- Do this until you get to a number larger than square root of n. Then you can circle all the numbers forward.

### There are infinitely many primes

Assume there are only finiately many ones. Multiply them all and add 1. This new number produces a prime that is not in the list.

### Definition

Let $\pi(n)$ be the number of primes smaller than or equal to $n$. This function is apropriately called the **prime counting function**

## Prime number theorem

$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} 
\frac{\pi(n)}
{n/\ln(n)}
=1
$$

wouldn't it be cool to know how to prove this?
