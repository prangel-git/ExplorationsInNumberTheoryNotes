A subset $H \subseteq G$ is a **subgroup** of $G$ :iff $H$ forms a group under the same operation as $G$.

The subgroup generated by $g \in G$ is the smallest subgroup containing $g$ and it is denoted by $\langle g \rangle$, and it can be found as $\{ g^k \in G | k \in \mathbb{Z}\}$. 

A group $G$ is called **cyclic** :iff there is a $g \in G$ such that $\langle g \rangle = G$.

## Lemma
Suppose $g \in G$ has finite order. Then the order of the cyclic subgroup generated by $g$ is equal to the order $g \in G$. That is $|\langle g \rangle|=|g|$.
