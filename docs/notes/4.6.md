# Preliminaries

A subset $H \subseteq G$ is a **subgroup** of $G$ :iff $H$ forms a group under the same operation as $G$.

The subgroup generated by $g \in G$ is the smallest subgroup containing $g$ and it is denoted by $\langle g \rangle$, and it can be found as $\{ g^k \in G | k \in \mathbb{Z}\}$. 

A group $G$ is called **cyclic** :iff there is a $g \in G$ such that $\langle g \rangle = G$.

## Lemma
Suppose $g \in G$ has finite order. Then the order of the cyclic subgroup generated by $g$ is equal to the order $g \in G$. That is $|\langle g \rangle|=|g|$. 

## Left congruence mod H

Given a subgroup $H$ of a group $G$, we say that $a \in G$ is **left congruent** to $b \in G$ **modulo** $H$ :iff $a^{-1} b \in H$, and we write $a \equiv b \mod H$.

### Theorem 
Congruence mod $H$ is an equivalence relationship on the set $G$

## Left cosets
Given a subgroup $H \subseteq G$, and $a \in G$, the set $aH = \{ah \in G | h \in H \}$ is called the **left coset** of $H$ containing $a$.

### Lemma
$$
|aH| = |H|
$$

# Lagranges Theorem

If $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, then $|H|$ divides $|G|$.

# Euler's theorem

If $\gcd(a,n)$ then $a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \mod n$.

## Fermat's little theorem
If $p \in \mathbb{Z}$ is prime, then $a^p \equiv a \mod p$.

### Corollary

The order of every element $a \in \mathbb{Z}/(n)^\times$ divides $\phi(n)$.

## Corollary
$$
a^{k} \equiv a^{k \mod \phi(n)} \mod n
$$

## Corollary
For every prime $p > 3$, any $a \in \mathbb{Z}/(p)$ is a cube.

## The freshman's binomial theorem
For any $x, y \in \mathbb{Z}$, and a prime number $p$, $(x+y)^p=x^p+y^p \mod p$.
