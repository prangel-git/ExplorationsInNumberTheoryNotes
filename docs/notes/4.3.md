You can reduce number modulo $n$ before operating in them. This idea is expressed by the following lemma

### Lemma

If $f \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ and $a \in \mathbb{Z}$ then

$$
f(a \mod n) \equiv f(a) \pmod n
$$

### Theorem (Divisibility by 9)

A number $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ is divisible by $9$ if and only if the sum of its digits in base $10$ is divisible by $9$

### Exercise

The diophantine equation $a^2+b^2=n$ has no solution if $n \equiv 3 \pmod 4$

### Definition

Given a polynomial $f \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$, we obtain its mod-n reduction $\bar{f} \in \mathbb{Z}/(n)[x]$ by reducing all of its coefficients mod $n$. 

### Theorem (mod-n root test)

If a diophantine equation has a solution in $\mathbb{Z}$, then it has a solution in $\mathbb{Z}/(n)$ for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$. 

If a diophantine equation has no solution in $\mathbb{Z}/(n)$ for some $n$, then it has no solution in $\mathbb{Z}$.
