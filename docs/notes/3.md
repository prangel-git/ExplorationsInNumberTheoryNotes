# Algebraic structures

## Rings

A **ring** is an algebraic structure $(R, +, \cdot, 0)$ where $R$ is a set, $+$ and $\cdot$ are binary operations, and $0$ is an element of $R$. The structure $(R,+,0)$ is an abelian group, and the structure $(R, \cdot)$ is a semigroup. The operations of $*$ and $\cdot$ are related by distributivity laws:

$$
a\cdot(b+c)
= a \cdot b + a \cdot c
\qquad
(a+b) \cdot c
= a \cdot c + b \cdot c
$$


When $(R, \cdot)$ contains an identity, we say that $R$ is a **ring with unity**.

When the operation $\cdot$ is commutative we say that $R$ is **a commutative ring**.

A **field** is a commutative ring with identity in which every nonzero element has an inverse.

An **integral domain** is a commutative ring such that $a \cdot b = 0$ if and only if $a=0$ or $b=0$.

### Lemma
Every Field is an integral domain but not every integral domain is a field.

### Lemma
If $R$ is an integral domain then for $f,g \in R[x]$, $\text{deg}(f \cdot g) = \text{deg}(f)+\text{deg}(g)$

### Lemma 
Let $R$ be an integral domain. Every non-zero polynomial $f \in R[x]$ of degree $d$ has at most $d$ roots.

## Divisibility

Let $R$ be a commutative ring, and $a, b \in R$. IF there is an element $k \in R$ such that $a \cdot k = b$, then we will write $a \mid b$ and we will say that $a$ **divides** $b$, or that $a$ is a **divisor** of $b$, or that $a$ is a **factor** of $b$, or that $b$ is a **multiple** of $a$. 

When $a$ does NOT divide $b$, we will write $a \nmid b$.
