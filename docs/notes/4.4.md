### Theorem

The number $[a] \in \mathbb{Z}/(n)$ has a multiplicative inverse if and only if $\gcd(a,n) = 1$.

### Corollary
For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the following are equivalent:

1. $n$ is prime.
2. $\mathbb{Z}/(n)$ is a field
3. $\mathbb{Z}/(n)$ is an integral domain.

### Lemma

Let $p$ be prime. Then $[a]=[a]^{-1} \in \mathbb{Z}/(n)$ implies $a = \pm 1$.

### Wilson's theorem

Let $p$ be prime. Then

$$
(p-1)! \equiv -1 \pmod p
$$

## Methods for calculating exponentials mod n

How can we calculate $a^b \pmod n$

1. Calculate $a^b$ and then find the residue modulo $n$ ($a^b$ grows fast so this is very inefficient)
2. Reduce $a$ modulo $n$ and then do the exponentiation (better but still very inefficient)
3. Recursively calculate $a^b = a^{b-a}a$ but at each step reduce the calculation modulo $n$. (better but still inefficient)
4. Write $b$ in base $2$ as $b = \sum b_i 2^i$. Calculate $a^b =\prod a^{b_i 2^i}$. The advantage here is that $a$, $a^2=a \cdot a$, $a^4 = a^2 \cdot a^2$ can be calculated faster recursively.
5. Wouldn't it be cool if we could find a number $c$ such that $a^{c}=1 \pmod n$ for every $a \in \mathbb{Z}/(p)$? That will certainly make the calculation of exponentials easier.
